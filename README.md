# Trellopoly
**Play Monopoly using Trello**

This is an academic gamification project to learn how to use Trello.

## About the project
**Trello** is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. 
In one glance, "Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process". More info here: [Trello](https://help.trello.com/article/708-what-is-trello). 

The **aim** of the project is to introduce students of different educational levels to Trello.

*This project was developed as a **bachelor thesis** by **Simone Faggi***. 

The thesis is available as PDF here: [**Trello gamification: studio di uno strumento di sviluppo agile**](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/16775/)
