# Trellopoly
**Play Monopoly using Trello**

This is an academic gamification project to learn how to use Trello.

## About the project
**Trello** is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. More info here: [Trello](https://help.trello.com/article/708-what-is-trello). 

Trello is a powerful tool that every (not only) computer science student must know. Thus, the **aim** of the project is to introduce students of different educational levels to Trello.

*This project was developed as a Bachelor Thesis by **Simone Faggi***
